# What's for Dinner

This is a dinner dish idea generator that allows you to pull up random dish names.

## Motivation

This project was completed in a Turing Mod 1 project to practice and learn how to implement this type of code.

https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html

## Languages

Written in Javascript, CSS, and HTML

## Technology used

Build with Atom

Code stored on GitHub

Running on GitHub Pages

## How to use?

The site is live at https://hayleyw7.github.io/whats-for-dinner/.

When the home view loads, one is asked "What are you looking for?" The person can select either "Side", "Main Dish", or "Dessert" to be presented with a corresponding dish after clicking "LET'S COOK!"

One can click "LET'S COOK!" again to cycle through different options, and one can clear the right dish display box by clicking "CLEAR".
